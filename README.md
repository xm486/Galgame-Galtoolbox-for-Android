# Galgame工具箱-Galtoolbox-for-Android
目前已部署在:https://xm486.github.io/  可先行测试体验网页版  
  
基于前端html+css+JavaScript静态开发并通过WebCat应用打包成app的Android web app。该软件主要实现的功能是更好的服务于Gal玩家的体验，更方便的寻找资源，做了各大gal网站资源整合，以及补丁，资料，音乐等，正在开发中。蓄势待发()
  
该项目代码主要由ai辅助开发，使用了但不限于豆包，deepseek，腾讯元宝，千问等ai工具。    
文件夹里的readme.txt是占位符，不用在意()   

未来更新:可能换引擎重做，现在这个本质上还是html网页，很多功能没法真正实现。  
  
画大饼的更新计划:  
1.更换引擎，争取实现原生安卓 口  
2.一个在手机上可以读取bangumi/vndb等游戏数据库获取游戏信息，然后记录玩家游玩gal的时长，并有可能的话，同步到云端?() 口   
3.模拟器专区，有详细对模拟器的介绍和运行方法，以及能游玩的游戏类型，更方便的寻找适合你的模拟器，并给出最优配置? 口   
4.内置ai屏幕翻译功能，实现不再困扰于生肉资源() 口  
5.as soon on......
  
更新日志:
1.0:
经过几天时间和ai斗智斗勇，期间我也在不断恶补各种专业知识，第一个正式版本算是成功落地了。这个版本一共做了包括首页在内的5个网页，js/css文件并没有完全从html分离，只整合了一部分，so 代码不是很规范()
目前实现的功能是可以导航到热门的gal资源/补丁网站，gal攻略/资讯/论坛/评分网站，其实也就相当于一个导航页了()，然后小工具是出于个人喜好做的一个页面，以后会更新一些个人推荐的实用小工具。

At present, it has been deployed in: https://xm486.github.io/ can test and experience the web version of Android Web app which is statically developed based on front-end html+css+JavaScript and packaged into an app through WebCat application. The main functions of the software are to better serve the experience of Gal players, to find resources more conveniently, to integrate the resources of major gal websites, as well as patches, materials, music, etc., which are under development. Ready to go () The code of this project is mainly developed by ai, using but not limited to ai tools such as Bean Pack, deepseek, Tencent Yuanbao and Qianwen. The readme.txt in the folder is a placeholder, so don't worry about () future updates: it may be redone by changing the engine. Now this is still an html page in essence, and many functions can't be really realized. Update plan for drawing pie: 1. Replace the engine to realize the native Android port. 2. A mobile phone can read the game database such as bangumi/vndb to get the game information, and then record the time that players play gal, and if possible, synchronize it to the cloud? () mouth 3. Simulator area, with detailed introduction and operation methods of simulators, as well as the types of games that can be played, making it easier to find the simulator that suits you and give the optimal configuration? Mouth 4. Built-in ai screen translation function, to realize that it is no longer bothered by raw meat resources () mouth 5.as soon on ... Update the log: 1.0: After a few days of wits and wits with ai, during which I was constantly catching up on various professional knowledge, the first official version was successfully launched. In this version, there are five web pages including the home page. The js/css file is not completely separated from html, but only part of it is integrated. The so code is not very standardized. () The current function is to navigate to the popular gal resource/patch website, gal strategy/information/forum/rating website, which is actually equivalent to a navigation page. () Then the gadget is a page made for personal preference, and some personal recommendations will be updated in the future.
